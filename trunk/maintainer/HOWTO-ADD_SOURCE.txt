Maintainer Add Source Files
***************************

Almost any new .cpp or .h files will have to be added to GNUmakefile.auto.am .
It is trivial to add hand-written source files. Just add them to the list
for the particular library or program which already exists. For example,
to add a source file to the libmp4v2:

    libmp4v2_la_SOURCES = ...

If you desire a header file to installed during 'make install' such
as 'mp4v2.h' it should be taken out of _SOURCES and added to:

    nobase_include_HEADERS = ...
