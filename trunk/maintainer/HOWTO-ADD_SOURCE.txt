Maintainer Add Source Files
***************************

Almost any new .cpp or .h files will have to be added to GNUmakefile.auto.am .
It is trivial to add hand-written source files. Just add them to the list
for the particular library or program which already exists. For example,
to add a source file to the libmp4v2:

    libmp4v2_la_SOURCES = ...

If you desire a header file to installed during 'make install' such
as 'mp4v2.h' it should be taken out of _SOURCES and added to:

    nobase_include_HEADERS = ...

Once done, autotool file such as configure will need to be regenerated.
If the project is in maintainer-mode, this will likely be done for you
automagically at the next 'make'. If you're not in maintainer mode or
would like to do it manually, then issue the following command:

    autoreconf -v

And eventually you will be checking in your local changes. Don't be
alarmed if generated autotool files such as configure, aclocal.m4
are changed and marked for check-in, as this is expected. We do not
desire to add autom4te.cache as these are temporary files created
as a side-effect from autoreconf.
