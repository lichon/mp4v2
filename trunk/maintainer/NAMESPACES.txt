Maintainer C++ Namespace Notes
******************************

Namespaces have been employed to help organize source and push all private
symbols (those which are not part of the public C API) to a location
that is unlikely to be accidentially used by anyone. It also virtually
eliminates any chance that private impl symbols will cause symbol collisions
at compile or link-time.

The global namespace is used by C API which generally prefixes all
of its symobls with MP4 to avoid collisions. This space is used by
src/mp4.cpp and include/mp4v2/mp4v2.h .

The namespace 'mp4v2' is reserved for future C++ API. There is no code
today which uses it.

The namespace 'mp4v2::impl' is a private namespace for our C++ implementation
code. We are nominating ourselves as the defacto owners of 'mp4v2' and can
pretty much guarantee our impl will never collide with anything.

The namespace 'mp4v2::platform' is private and used for code which abstracts
various plaform differences or implements missing features.

The namespace 'mp4v2::util' is private and used only for util/ programs.
