@section Solaris
Building on Solaris is supported.
The following are the recommended specifications for this platform; but is
not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
@item Solaris 10u6, gcc 3.4.3
@item gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
@end itemize

@include platform.common.bundled.texi
@quotation Note
Solaris' does not (yet) really bundle a compiler. The recommendation
is to use the companion-disk compiler for maximum c++ runtime
compatibility. It is usually found in @file{/usr/sfw/bin}.
@end quotation

@include platform.common.conf.default.texi
@include platform.common.conf.bi.texi
