@section Windows
Native builds on Windows is supported via Microsoft's Visual Studio package.
Both the commerical version and free version (express) are known to work.
The following are the recommended specifications for this platform; but is
not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
@item Windows 2000 or higher, Visual Studio 9.0 (AKA. Visual Studio 2008)
@item Visual Studio 9.0 Express is reported to work
@end itemize

Only 32-bit binaries are targeted, and win32-API is set to Windows 2000
or higher. Older versions of Windows, or win32-API are not supported.

@value{PROJECT_name} has directory @file{vstudio9.0/} which contains
the necessary solution+project files to produce a basic build of libmp4v2's
DLL and several command-line executables. Enabling things such as
debugging, optimization, etc, are all left as an excercise to the user.

@quotation Warning
Project meta-data such as versioning is found in
@file{vstudio9.0/include/mp4v2/project.h} and may be out of date.
If you are building from a @value{PROJECT_name} bundle
(not the repository!) then you can simply overwrite it with
@file{include/mp4v2/project.h} but if you are building from the project
repository, you may need to obtain that file via other means, such as
from a similar-versioned bundle (ie: latest snapshot).
