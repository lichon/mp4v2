Extract sources from an @value{PROJECT_name} distribution bundle.
Releases can be found in the downloads section at @value{PROJECT_website}.

@example
tar xf @value{PROJECT_name_lower}-@value{PROJECT_version}.tar.bz2
cd @value{PROJECT_name_lower}-@value{PROJECT_version}/
@end example

Older versions of @code{tar} may not automatically uncompress the file,
so you might have to either enter additional flags manually, or first
decompress the bundle before extracting.
