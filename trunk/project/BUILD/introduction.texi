The supported method of building @value{PROJECT_name} is described in this
document. The process is divided into distinct phases.

obtain sources
pre-configure
configure
build
install
produce source distribution

The first step in building @value{PROJECT_name} is to download the latest
source distribution, usually made available in tarballs or zip format.
This contains all files necessary to configure, build and install
@value{PROJECT_name}.

Alternately, project maintainers and ambitious users build directly from
@value{PROJECT_name}'s repository. This of course is more complex and
is not recommended for the novice.

Building is explained as several distinct phases.

@section Pre-Configuration
This phase is only required when building directly from the respository.
Typically only project maintainers build from the repository but also
some ambitious users may want to try the latest sources.

@quotation Note
This phase is not applicable when not using GNU autotools, such as
building on the Windows platform.
@end quotation

GNU autotools are generated from repository files such as @file{configure.ac}.
Once a makefile is built it does a good job of automatically regenerating
files but it is unaware of high-level @value{PROJECT_name} meta-data found
in @file{project/project.m4}. While this data rarely changes, it is important
to note that you must manually autoreconf when the file changes.

@example
autoreconf -fiv
@end example
